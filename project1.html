<p>The MA3RS project or <b>M</b>RI for <b>A</b>bdominal <b>A</b>ortic <b>A</b>neurysms to predict <b>R</b>upture or <b>S</b>urgery: is an MRC funded initiative to provide a better marker of patient rupture risk to replace the current gold standard of a single diameter measurement (e.g. >55mm).
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>The aim of this aspect of the MA3RS project is to determine the spatial relationship between regions of inflammation as defined by USPIO uptake and biomechanical wall stress calculated using  the Finite Element method (FE). This is achieved through the creation and analysis of finite element models of abdominal aortic aneurysms using patient specific data (e.g. CT/MRI).
