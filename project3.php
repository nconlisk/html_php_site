<p>Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is an MRI based imaging technique utilising a phase-encoding gradient to track shear waves induced by an external driver in order to obtain measurements of the mechanical properties of soft tissues. 
</td></tr><tr><td>The primary objective of the project is to obtain stiffness maps of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA's) that can be incorporated into computational analyses calculating the stress acting upon the vessel wall. This information will be used as to predict the risk of AAA rupture.
